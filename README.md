# Hi, I'm MujeerðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer specialising in **AI**, **DevOps** and **Backend Development**. I work at a tech startup called [Bolna](https://bolna.ai) developing their Voice AI agents. I previously worked at [ExactSpace](https://exactspace.co), contributing to their Digital Twin technology that provides real-time predictions for power plants.

I have a deep passion for System Architecture, Distributed Systems, Databases Internals, Language Internals, and Advanced Algorithms.
