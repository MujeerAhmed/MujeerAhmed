# Hi, I'm Mujeer👋
I'm a software engineer specialising in **DevOps** and **Backend Development**. I work at a tech startup [ExactSpace](https://exactspace.co), contributing to their Digital Twin technology that provides real-time predictions for power plants.

I have a deep passion for System Architecture, Distributed Systems, Databases Internals, Language Internals, and Advanced Algorithms.
